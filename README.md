# Sketchpad Reload

Sketchpad Reload is Node module that provides file watching and live-reloading capability for [Laravel Sketchpad](https://github.com/davestewart/laravel-sketchpad).

By default it:

- watches all controller, asset and view folders
- reloads changes to loaded scripts and styles
- re-runs the current method if the controller is updated
- re-runs the current method when additionally-watched files are updated, added or deleted
- reloads the navigation when any controllers updated, added or deleted

Sketchpad Reload also runs as a standalone script â€“ no need to integrate with any build processes!


See the [wiki](https://github.com/davestewart/laravel-sketchpad-reload/wiki) for installation and setup instructions.
